# Our Challenge

We would like thank Nasa for sharing the amounts of satellite data that we all have freely available for all 

# The Problem

Countless phenomena such as floods, fires, and algae blooms routinely impact ecosystems, economies, and human safety. Your challenge is to use satellite data to create a machine learning model that detects a specific phenomenon and build an interface that not only displays the detected phenomenon, but also layers it alongside ancillary data to help researchers and decision-makers better understand its impacts and scope.

# Our Solution

We are developing an application that allows the visualization of fire outbreaks in Brazil and in the world and also the identification of the risk of burning in the national territory, indicating its location and also the biome to be affected, the application will also notify the user if he is in an at-risk area, and will alert authorities that provisional actions are taken in high-risk fire regions.
